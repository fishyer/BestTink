- use [`scrollbar-gutter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-gutter) attribute instead of `overflow: overlay` #[[CSS standards]]
	- the latter is non-standard
	- not sure why but React wiped out this attribute?
- LATER understanding Clojure atom. read #[[Clojure for the Brave and True]]
- [[valtio]] is the production ready solution to my custom "store" implementation explained in ((6257927f-903b-4adf-8344-43832f23bd4d))
- LATER [[Why we don't have a parent selector]]
- DONE [[pengx17/logseq-publish]] failed because the Logseq changed onboarding look & feel. Need to update the Playwright scripts.
