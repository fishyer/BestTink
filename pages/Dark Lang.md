  > Dark is a new way of building serverless backends. Just code your backend, with no infra, framework or deployment nightmares.
- First impression
	- Using ^^UI diagrams^^ drawing in "canvas" to provide backend & API for the frontend and a ^^strongly typed DSL^^. Also, the language's ^^Autocomplete^^ is also great
	- Not sure if it is easy to share your code to others. Sharing the _Canvas_ seems very dangerous to me.
- Now in private beta. Created my account under namespace `pengx17` on [[Jul 30th, 2021]]
