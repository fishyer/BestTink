- ## Some backgrounds of implementing the GitHub Action
  collapsed:: true
	- There are some good public knowledge gardens that are powered by Logseq already that you can find on the Web. To list a few:
		- https://zhanghanduo.com/
		- https://note.xuanwo.io/
		- [Logseq's official document](https://logseq.github.io/)
		  id:: 61d5b000-04ce-4725-8f39-3381afaf4ee7
	- Imagine a normal user who uses GitHub Repo to sync his Logseq graph and use **GitHub Pages** to host it.
		- the git repo's folder may structure like this. e.g., https://github.com/pengx17/knowledge-garden
		- ```
		  â”œâ”€â”€ assets
		  â”œâ”€â”€ draws
		  â”œâ”€â”€ logseq
		  â”œâ”€â”€ pages
		  â””â”€â”€ www
		  ```
			- `logseq`/`asset`/`pages` etc contains the normal graph files
			- `www` contains the public assets of the page, which is picked up by GitHub Pages
				- it is also possible if the user publish `www` to `gh-pages` branch
		- in a daily workflow, the user needs to [follow the instructions](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/Publishing%20(Desktop%20App%20Only)) on ((61d5b000-04ce-4725-8f39-3381afaf4ee7)) to publish his graph
			- be on the Desktop App
			- take some notes (don't forget to mark related pages as public, or mark all pages as public)
			- remove old `www` folder
			- ==export pages as a static website==
			  id:: 61d5b13f-8c3c-4434-b112-f55e6275bef1
				- click the three dots in the top-right of menu bar
				- click "export graph"
				- click "Export public pages" to `www`
			- commit the generated assets & push to GitHub
			- if GitHub Pages is configured correctly, the new pages will be deployed soon
		- The issue about this approach is that we can only do ((61d5b13f-8c3c-4434-b112-f55e6275bef1)) **manually**.
			- If I published a page and then found there are some notes need correction, he needs to go over the tedious steps again. ðŸ¤¦
- ## A failed attempt on Logseq Publish CLI
	- People in the [Logseq Discord channel](https://discord.gg/KpN4eHY) is asking if Logseq can provide a CLI to do this in a shell script.
		- The team replies that this is on their roadmap, but no ETA
		- I think this is not a high priority task to the Logseq team yet
	- Maybe it can be started right now to drive by the devs in the community.
		- I found it interesting and attempted to port the graph load & export in using Node.js a while ago, but failed for some reasons
			- I am not that familiar with [[ClojureScript]] and the codes of how graph files are loaded(parse to tokens, AST with block hierarchy etc) and exported seems very complex
			- Logseq is changing in a fast pace. Maintaining it also take a lot of efforts and I may not get the *right* results anyway.
			- The ROI (Return on investment) is very low IMHO
		- Because of this, I retreated from porting the graph loading & exporting and seeking other solutions.
- ## Publish with Headless Logseq Desktop App?
	- Logseq desktop is running in Electron. So I suppose if I can
		- run Logseq desktop app headlessly
		- drive it with an automation tool
		  id:: 61d5c1bc-e545-418d-a677-5f4c53ccaf8c
			- let the automation tool to drive Logseq app and publish the graph
	- This approach was very simple in theory, but I got stuck immediately on ((61d5c1bc-e545-418d-a677-5f4c53ccaf8c)) step.
		- The only tool I tried is [[Cypress]], because it was the tool I knew and it seems to be an industry standard on e2e testing for the Web
		- However, Cypress does not support testing Electron Apps (Logseq is powered by Electron) _yet_. #[[Cypress with Electron]]
	- Then few months later, in the following tweet, I found a change by the new Logseq's team member [[Mono Wang]] that he **used [[Playwright]] to replace Cypress** to test the Desktop App
		- {{tweet https://twitter.com/tiensonqin/status/1463784645447667715}}
		- WOW, I did not expect Playwright has this ability! Good job **Microsoft**!
			- My expectation to Playwright was that it is a universal solution to drive popular browsers including Chromium based browsers, Firefox and Safari
			- I did not expect it also has the ability to [automate Electron](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-electron)
- ---
- ## Releasing of [[pengx17/logseq-publish]]
	- In a few more tries with the new approach , I managed to publish [[pengx17/logseq-publish]] on the last day of 2021
	- One last missing part is that we need to **bypass Electron's open dir dialog when running with Playwright** in Logseq
		- patched by https://github.com/logseq/logseq/pull/3531
			- with this patch, we can also add e2e tests to testing graph load & publish cases
		- when the browser context has a  `__MOCKED_OPEN_DIR_PATH__` flag, the open dir dialog will not show, but use this mocked directory directly.
	- The publish script is running in a Docker image build step
		- The reason of using Docker is because of its portability
		- There are two images
			- [Dockerfile](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-publish/blob/main/Dockerfile) prepare for `Docker.exec`.
				- build Logseq desktop app
				  id:: 61d7a4e2-2598-45bb-bb24-510f694c4afa
				- prepare for playwright
			- [Dockerfile.exec](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-publish/blob/main/Dockerfile.exec) to run ((61d70a4d-a7e4-4888-96ab-f5a02b0f3f50))
		- Why two docker images?
			- ((61d7a4e2-2598-45bb-bb24-510f694c4afa)) takes ~12 mins.
				- We can pre-build it and publish it to [ghcr.io](ghcr.io). So that the user can build his graph in `Docker.exec` directly without building Logseq App from the beginning.
			- As a result, the time of exporting this graph only takes _2 mins_ in a GitHub Action.
	- `publish.mjs`
	  id:: 61d70a4d-a7e4-4888-96ab-f5a02b0f3f50
		- use Playwright to automate the Logseq App to load the given input graph dir
		- set `window.__MOCKED_OPEN_DIR_PATH__` to the current working dir (e.g., `./graph`) when load the graph
		- after graph loaded, go to export it by set `window__MOCKED_OPEN_DIR_PATH__` to `./graph-www`
	- The main body of [[GitHub Action]] is just a shell script that will
		- download [Dockerfile.exec](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-publish/blob/main/Dockerfile.exec) to the user's graph root
		- build the docker image
			- As a result, the public assets will be in the image snapshot
		- copy the public assets from the docker container to the destination folder
		- to deploy your pages, you can then pipe the result with [github-pages-deploy-action](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action)
	- A complete workflow example for this graph
		- ```yml
		  # This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
		  
		  name: CI
		  
		  # Controls when the workflow will run
		  on:
		    push:
		      branches: [main]
		  
		    # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
		    workflow_dispatch:
		  
		  # A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
		  jobs:
		    # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
		    build:
		      # The type of runner that the job will run on
		      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
		  
		      # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
		      steps:
		        # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
		        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
		        - name: Logseq Publish ðŸš©
		          uses: pengx17/logseq-publish@0.1.0
		        - name: add a nojekyll file
		          run: touch $GITHUB_WORKSPACE/www/.nojekyll
		        - name: Deploy ðŸš€
		          uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.9
		          with:
		            branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
		            folder: www # The folder the action should deploy.
		            clean: true
		  ```

- As of [[Thu, 2022/01/06]], Logseq's official Docs is already using this action to publish the docs!
	- {{tweet https://twitter.com/logseq/status/1479115586437222405}}
- [[Mon, 2022/01/10]]
	- Contributor [[Xuanwo]] and reported some publish issues
	- DONE Should have a better way to determine the timing when publish is finished

	- Edit the custom.css file failed in https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-publish/issues/19
		- Seems the custom.css file is owned by `root` user
			- github action runs with `runner` user
			- https://www.baeldung.com/linux/redirect-output-permission-denied
		- Fixed by change file permission owners to `runner` in a following step
-
- Debugging
	- when downloaded the `trace` file from artifacts, make sure unzip it first using `unzip` on Mac
		- Using default Mac unzip in finder will recursively unzip a zip file if there is only one zip file, until no zip file found
