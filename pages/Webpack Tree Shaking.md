- Recently got a issue for demos in [[Code Kitchen]] that some runtime dependencies are not found in production build
	- It seems to be related to [[Webpack]] tree shaking
		- https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/#optimizationprovidedexports
		- > ... which exports are provided by modules to generate more efficient code for `export * from ....` By default optimization.providedExports is enabled.
	- The issue will surface if use babel instead of [[SWC]]
		- https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/build/babel/preset.ts
		- I think Babel did the correct job
