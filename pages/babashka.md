	- aka, `nbb`
	  id:: 622acb40-e137-433a-8f75-d75089d73dfe
	- importing `default`

		- What does $default mean?
		  The :default foo syntax is shadow-cljs only and not supported by vanilla CLJS (and nbb doesn't support it either). The $default syntax is a recent addition to CLJS and should work in shadow-cljs too: this is why nbb supports it too.
		- See here for more infor on that syntax.
		- Nbb implements :require via dynamic import (import() in JS). This is why you need to add $default to imports when you want to import the default object from a module.
- Setup
	- config with `bb.edn` (bb is short for babashka)
		- example in Logseq that is for running scripts with bb
-
- My current setup for REPL & playing around CLJS for ((622705ee-0ea3-49cd-92f9-2a5c6c28e599))
	- vscode + Calvas plugin
	- Open an empty project, create a `test.cljs` file
	- Kick off Calvas "Startup a REPL and Connect aka Jack-in"
	- Select [[nbb]] as the project type
	- Done!
