title:: Is Clojure good for making games?

- [URL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/buj0sl/is_clojure_a_reasonable_option_for_games/)
- [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/), a Java game engine
- TL;DR
	- no proper toolings. IDE etc
	- Clojure favors immutable data structures, but may not suitable for games
	- [Arcadia](http://arcadia-unity.github.io/) is a Clojure wrapper for Unity. But I think it is no longer maintained.
