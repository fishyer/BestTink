	- Knowledge of the core library
		- Find out the most suitable functions is hard
		- Since Clojure is a [[hosted language]], it is possible to use Java or JavaScript libraries, which makes interpolation harder
			- That is why the core library provides library like `clojure.string`
		- Math special namespace for [[ClojureScript]] https://cljs.github.io/api/syntax/Math-namespace
		- ((622af365-535c-4bdc-af35-e0f5e9276120))
	- Lack of static typing system and Nullability checks
	- REPL driven development
		- some videos in practice?

	- For JS, we have many kinds of tools to upgrade library version in CI (Renovate, dependbot, etc), but for Clojure, the API could stay for several years because of the simplicity of language.
