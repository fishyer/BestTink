- `flatten` will do flat recursively
- `=` compares values, not the identity (reference)
	- https://clojure.org/guides/equality
	- `=` for single value is always true, even for `nil`
	- map's order is not significant
		- ```clojure
		  ;; = can be used to compare the equality of nested Clojure data structures
		  (= {:a [1 {1 2}] :b 'ok :c "string"} 
		     {:b 'ok :c "string" :a '(1 {1 2})})
		  ;;=> true
		  ```

- `every?` + `some`, (not `some?`, which is to testify if something is `nil`)
- plain number literals in Clojure is `long` (int 64), but for JS, this will be `double` (float64)
